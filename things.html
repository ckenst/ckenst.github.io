        <p>A few random and fun things about me.

        <p>In college I sold computers for Gateway. Eventually I found myself on the early morning television show Good Day Sacramento helping to answer computer questions for call in guests. (This was a very long time ago and embarrassing for me to watch.)

        <p>We spent a day on-set of <a href="http://www.fxnetworks.com/shows/its-always-sunny-in-philadelphia/episodes" target="_blank" rel="noopener">It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia</a> and got pictures with the cast members:
