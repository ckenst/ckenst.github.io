        A lot of the dives I do are with students for classes. When it comes to fun dives I’m a self-reliant diver who enjoys exploring new sites, taking photographs and diving with people who are more experienced than I am. Keeping track of my dive experience is important, so I’ve kept all of my log books from my training dives in 2006 until today.

        I have over 180 hours underwater, primarily in the cold water of Southern California but have dove in several countries including Mexico, the Philippines and Australia. Counting the number of dives over time isn’t a great way to track experience because dive locations and situations aren’t comparable so I keep track of my hours underwater (the real experience).
